**Please note**: This plugin is work in progress and NOT ready to use.

**Its intention**:

- users will be enabled to automatically create a [nanopub](https://nanopub.net/) using a workflow's metadata
- this nanopub can subsequently be referenced in publications and thereby covering __all__ metadata necessary to scrutinize an analysis (all too often crucial data are missing from publications)
